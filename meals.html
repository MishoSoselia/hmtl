            <p>Khinkali (Georgian: ხინკალი) is a very popular Georgian dumpling made of twisted knobs of dough, stuffed with meat and spices. It is considered to be one of the national dishes of Georgia.

              Different regions of Georgia make khinkali with different fillings. The most popular filling is a pork/beef mix. In the mountains, khinkali is often made with a lamb filling. Fillings can also include Imeretian cheese mixed with cottage cheese; mushrooms; and mashed potato. City versions include kalakuri khinkali (with thinly chopped parsley) and khevsuruli khinkali (without parsley).</p>

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Add 1.1 kilo of flour to a mixing bowl. Make a depression in the middle of the flour and add the eggs</li>

                <li>Mix the ingredients from the middle of the bowl until all of the flour is mixed</li>

                <li>Divide the dough into two pieces.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a work surface and one of the balls of dough with flour and knead (very firmly) and fold the dough</li>
                <li>Continue kneading and folding until the dough is very firm</li>
                <li>Roll out the dough until it is about 1/3 of an inch thick</li>
                <li>Cut out circles of about 2.5 inches in diameter with a drinking glass</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the excess dough</li>
                <li>Use a rolling pin to roll each circle into a thin eight inch round. These rounds will be filled with a meat and spice mixture to make khinkali</li>
                <li>NOTE: Repeat the whole process of kneading, folding and cutting and rolling of rounds with the remaining ball of dough. You will then have enough rounds to make about 30 khinkali</li>

          <h3>Eating khinkali</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>There is an art to eating Khinkali. The doughy top, where the pleats all meet, is never eaten, but used as a handle for holding the hot dumplings and is left on the plate to show how many have been eaten. In Georgia, this top is called the “kudi” (Georgian ქუდი, hat) or “kuchi” (Georgian კუჭი, belly button)</li>
